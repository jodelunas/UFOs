# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to add more options for filtering the UFO data. I added table filters for the city, state, country and shape to work with the previous date filter. The user can now filter the table with any, or all of the filters.

## Results

The image below shows how the filters are set up for the table.
### Date
* The user would enter a date found in the table, using single digit month and day, and four digit year.  Enter, or moving to next filter will filter the table

### City
* The city filter works by typing a city in the space provided.

### State
* The state filter works by typing the two letter state abbreviation.

### Country 
* The country filter works by entering an abbreviation for the country they choose. At this time only US is applicable.

### Shape
* For the shape filter, the user needs to enter a shape. The options are circle, light, triangle, unknown, fireball, formation, other, sphere, disk, chevron, rectangle, cross, flash, changing, oval, cigar, teardrop and cylindar.
